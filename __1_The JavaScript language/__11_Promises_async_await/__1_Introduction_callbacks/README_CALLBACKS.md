# Introduction: callbacks

> **We use browser methods in examples here**
> 
> To demonstrate the use of callbacks, promises and other abstract concepts, we'll be using some browser methods: specifically, loading scripts and performing simple document manipulations.
> 
> If you're not familiar with these methods, and their usage in the examples is confusing, you may want to read a few chapters from the [next part](https://javascript.info/document) of the tutorial.
> 
> Although, we'll try to make things clear anyway. There won't be anything really complex browser-wise.
