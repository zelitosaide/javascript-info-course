# Async/await

There's a special syntax to work with promises in a more comfortable fashion, called "async/await". It's surprisingly easy to understand and use.

## Async functions

Let's start with the `async` keyword. It can be placed before a function, like this:

```js
async function fn() {
  return 1;
}
```

The word "async" before a function means one simple thing: a function always returns a promise. Other values are wrapped in a resolved promise automatically.
