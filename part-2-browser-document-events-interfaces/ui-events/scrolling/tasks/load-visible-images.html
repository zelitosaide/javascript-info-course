    <h1>Solar system</h1>

    <p>
      The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that
      orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly,
      the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects,
      such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies.
      Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons,
      two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant
      interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority of the system's mass is in the Sun, with most
      of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus,
      Earth and Mars, are terrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock and metal.
      The four outer planets are giant planets, being substantially more massive than the terrestrials.
      The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium;
      the two outermost planets, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants,
      being composed mostly of substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen
      and helium, called volatiles, such as water, ammonia and methane.
      All planets have almost circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic.

    <h1>Mercury</h1>

    <p>
      Mercury (0.4 AU from the Sun) is the closest planet to the Sun and the smallest planet
      in the Solar System (0.055 Earth masses).
      Mercury has no natural satellites; besides impact craters, its only known geological features
      are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of contraction early in
      its history.[67] Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its
      surface by the solar wind.[68] Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle have not yet
      been adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a
      giant impact; or, that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.

    <h1>Venus</h1>

    <p>
      Venus (0.7 AU from the Sun) is close in size to Earth (0.815 Earth masses) and, like Earth,
      has a thick silicate mantle around an iron core, a substantial atmosphere, and evidence of
      internal geological activity. It is much drier than Earth, and its atmosphere is ninety times
        as dense. Venus has no natural satellites. It is the hottest planet, with surface temperatures
        over 400 °C (752°F), most likely due to the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.
      No definitive evidence of current geological activity has been detected on Venus,
      but it has no magnetic field that would prevent depletion of its substantial atmosphere,
        which suggests that its atmosphere is being replenished by volcanic eruptions.

    <h1>Earth</h1>

    <p>
      Earth (1 AU from the Sun) is the largest and densest of the inner planets,
      the only one known to have current geological activity, and the only place where life
      is known to exist. Its liquid hydrosphere is unique among the terrestrial planets,
      and it is the only planet where plate tectonics has been observed.
      Earth's atmosphere is radically different from those of the other planets,
      having been altered by the presence of life to contain 21% free oxygen.
      It has one natural satellite, the Moon, the only large satellite of a terrestrial planet
      in the Solar System.
