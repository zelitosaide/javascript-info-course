    <h2>Place superheroes around the soccer field.</h2>

    <p>
      Superheroes and the ball are elements with the class 
      "draggable". Make them really draggable.
    </p>

    <p>
      Important: limit dragging by the window. If a draggable reaches 
      window top or bottom, then the page should scroll to let us drag 
      it further.
    </p>

    <p>
      If your screen is big enough to fit the whole document -- make 
      the window smaller to get vertical scrolling, so that you could test it.
    </p>

    <p>
      In this task it's enough to handle vertical scrolling. There's no 
      horizontal scrolling usually, and it's handled the similar way if needed.
    </p>

    <p>
      And one more thing: heroes may never leave the page. If they reach 
      the edge of the document, no dragging outside of it.
