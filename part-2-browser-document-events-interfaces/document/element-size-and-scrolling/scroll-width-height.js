// These properties are like clientWidth/clientHeight, but they also include the scrolled out (hidden) parts:
// scrollHeight = 723 – is the full inner height of the content area including the scrolled out parts.
// scrollWidth = 324 – is the full inner width, here we have no horizontal scroll, so it equals clientWidth.
