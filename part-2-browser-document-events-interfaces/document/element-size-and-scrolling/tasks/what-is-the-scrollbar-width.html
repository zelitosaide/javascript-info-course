        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          This Ecma Standard is based on several originating technologies, the
          most well known being JavaScript (Netscape) and JScript (Microsoft).
          The language was invented by Brendan Eich at Netscape and first
          appeared in that company's Navigator 2.0 browser. It has appeared in
          all subsequent browsers from Netscape and in all browsers from
          Microsoft starting with Internet Explorer 3.0. The development of this
          Standard started in November 1996. The first edition of this Ecma
          Standard was adopted by the Ecma General Assembly of June 1997.
        </p>

        <p>
          That Ecma Standard was submitted to ISO/IEC JTC 1 for adoption under
          the fast-track procedure, and approved as international standard
          ISO/IEC 16262, in April 1998. The Ecma General Assembly of June 1998
          approved the second edition of ECMA-262 to keep it fully aligned with
          ISO/IEC 16262. Changes between the first and the second edition are
          editorial in nature.
        </p>

        <p>
          The third edition of the Standard introduced powerful regular
          expressions, better string handling, new control statements, try/catch
          exception handling, tighter definition of errors, formatting for
          numeric output and minor changes in anticipation of forthcoming
          internationalisation facilities and future language growth. The third
          edition of the ECMAScript standard was adopted by the Ecma General
          Assembly of December 1999 and published as ISO/IEC 16262:2002 in June
          2002.
