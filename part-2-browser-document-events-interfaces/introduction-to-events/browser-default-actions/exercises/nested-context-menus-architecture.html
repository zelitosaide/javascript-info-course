Nested context menus architecture

There are also alternative ways to implement nested 
context menus. One of them is to have a single global 
object with a handler for document.oncontextmenu, and 
also methods that allow us to store other handlers in it.

The object will catch any right-click, look through stored 
handlers and run the appropriate one.

But then each piece of code that wants a context menu should 
know about that object and use its help instead of the own 
contextmenu handler.
